ðŸ¤– Name: Ellie Day

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her

ðŸ’¬ My Background:
Born in 1999, I grew up with computers and tech, and I've always been fascinated by them. I started a YouTube channel as an 11 year old girl when I got my first video recorder and I taught myself how to take the footage, "edit" it, and then upload it with a Title, Thumbnail, and Description. It wasn't long before I started to record video game content. Over time I learned new things, I got higher quality tools and a better computer, and my skills improved. I learned how to *actually* edit a video, though initially my quality was still very poor. Eventually I learned about OBS and started streaming to Twitch as well, becoming a speedrunner and very delicating setting up my stack of software to provide the highest quality I could, with a unique style. I officially retired my YouTube and Twitch channels in 2022 and privated all of my content (Twitch is still public), though I hadn't recorded or streamed anything since 2020 except for private consumption. I went to vocational school from 2016 to 2018 where I got certifications in Microsoft Word/Excel/PowerPoint/Access 2016, and Photoshop (now expired). I also learned Visual Basic and C++ coding here. I went to Sinclair Community College from 2019 to 2021 and achieved an Associate's Degree in Software Engineering, where I learned more C++, some Java, and Python which I use mainly today. I also learned flowcharting, project design, and pseudocode markup. As a side gig, I briefly experimented with Photo Editing (mostly for YouTube thumbnails, miscellaneous icons, etc) and Audio Mixing and Mastering, though I would describe my skills in these fields entry level. Overall, there aren't many types of projects relating to computer work that, at the very least, I couldn't *assist in*, and at most, complete start to finish. I have added a few examples of my work in this repository, and if there are more examples in the future they will also be found here. I am available for freelancing! ðŸ˜Ž
